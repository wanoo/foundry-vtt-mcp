# FoundryMCP

A lightweight MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for FoundryVTT that communicates directly via WebSockets.

## Why This Server?

Unlike other FoundryVTT MCP servers that require:
- Installing a custom module on your Foundry server
- Running a headless browser

This server **natively authenticates** with FoundryVTT and exchanges WebSocket messages directly using the same protocol as the official Foundry client. This makes it:

- **Lightweight** - No browser overhead, just direct WebSocket communication
- **Zero server-side setup** - No modules to install on your Foundry instance
- **Secure** - Uses the same authentication flow as the official client

## Compatibility

Works with **FoundryVTT v13 and v14**. The server detects the Foundry generation automatically (via `GET /api/status`) and uses the correct session-binding method for that version — v14 changed how the WebSocket session is authenticated, and both are handled transparently with no configuration needed.

## Security Recommendation

**Create a dedicated FoundryVTT user for each game world you want the MCP server to access.** Grant that user only the permissions you want the MCP server to have. This provides:

- Fine-grained access control
- Clear audit trail of MCP actions
- Easy revocation if needed
- Isolation between different games/worlds

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Skills

The `./skills` directory contains LLM skills for this project. Currently the only skill there is `MAIN.skill`, and all users should install it because it includes the FoundryVTT-specific guidance and workflows. We welcome PRs that add skills for specific game systems, FoundryVTT modules, or other targeted use cases.

## Configuration

### Credentials File

Create a file at `config/foundry_credentials.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "my-campaign",
    "hostname": "your-foundry-server.com",
    "userid": "your-user-id",
    "password": "your-password"
  },
  {
    "_id": "test-world",
    "hostname": "test.foundry-server.com",
    "userid": "test-user-id",
    "password": "test-password"
  }
]
```

**Fields:**
- `_id` - A user-defined identifier for this credential entry (used to switch between instances)
- `hostname` - The domain/IP of your FoundryVTT server
- `userid` - Your Foundry user document ID (find by inspecting Users in Foundry admin panel)
- `password` - Your Foundry user password

You can configure multiple Foundry instances and switch between them at runtime using the `choose_foundry_instance` tool.

### Environment Variable

Override the default credentials path by setting:

```bash
export FOUNDRY_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/credentials.json
```

## Usage with MCP Clients

Add to your MCP client configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "foundry": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/FoundryMCP/build/server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or if installed globally:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "foundry": {
      "command": "foundry-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### World Metadata

#### `get_world`

Get world metadata from FoundryVTT (title, system, version, etc.), excluding document collections like actors or items. Use the `get_*` document tools for collection data.

### Document Manipulation

#### `modify_document`

Modify an existing document in FoundryVTT.

**Parameters:**
- `type` (string, required): Document type. Valid types:
  - Core: `Actor`, `Item`, `Scene`, `JournalEntry`, `Folder`, `User`, `Playlist`, `Macro`, `RollTable`, `Cards`, `ChatMessage`
  - Scene objects: `Combat`, `Combatant`, `ActiveEffect`, `Drawing`, `MeasuredTemplate`, `Note`, `Tile`, `Token`, `Wall`, `AmbientLight`, `AmbientSound`
- `_id` (string, required): The document's unique identifier
- `updates` (object[], required): Array of update objects with fields to modify

**Example - Update actor HP:**
```json
{
  "type": "Actor",
  "_id": "abc123",
  "updates": [{ "system": { "attributes": { "hp": { "value": 25 } } } }]
}
```

#### `create_document`

Create new documents in FoundryVTT.

**Parameters:**
- `type` (string, required): Document type to create
- `data` (object[], required): Array of document data objects

**Example - Create an item:**
```json
{
  "type": "Item",
  "data": [{ "name": "Healing Potion", "type": "consumable" }]

Show all configured Foundry credentials without revealing passwords. Returns the `_id`, `hostname`, `userid`, `item_order` (zero-based index), and `currently_active` status for each credential entry.

**Example response:**
```json
[
  {
    "_id": "my-campaign",
    "hostname": "your-foundry-server.com",
    "userid": "abc123",
    "item_order": 0,
    "currently_active": true
  },
  {
    "_id": "test-world",
    "hostname": "test.foundry-server.com",
    "userid": "def456",
    "item_order": 1,
    "currently_active": false
  }
]
```

#### `choose_foundry_instance`

Switch to a different Foundry instance. Disconnects from the current instance (if any) and connects to the specified one.

**Parameters (at least one required):**
- `item_order` (integer): Zero-based index of the credential in the array
- `_id` (string): The user-defined identifier for the credential entry

**Example - Switch by item_order:**

```

**Example - Switch by _id:**
```json
{
  "_id": "test-world"
}
```

## Tips

### Understanding Document Structure

Document schemas vary significantly between game systems (D&D 5e, Pathfinder, etc.). Use the `get_*` tools to inspect existing documents before attempting to modify or create new ones.

### Filtering with `where`

All collection retrieval tools (`get_actors`, `get_items`, etc.) support the `where` parameter for filtering results. The `where` parameter accepts an object with key-value pairs that documents must match.

**How it works:**
- Each key-value pair in `where` is a condition that must be satisfied
- All conditions use **AND logic** - a document must match ALL conditions to be included
- Values are compared using strict equality

**Example - Get actors in a specific folder:**
```json
{
  "where": {
    "folder": "abcd1234"
  }
}
```

**Example - Get NPC actors in a specific folder:**
```json
{
  "where": {
    "folder": "abcd1234",
    "type": "npc"
  }
}
```
This returns only actors where `folder` equals `"abcd1234"` AND `type` equals `"npc"`.

**Example - Get items of a specific type:**
```json
{
  "where": {
    "type": "weapon"
  }
}
```

**Example - Combine with other parameters:**
```json
{
  "where": {
    "folder": "abcd1234"
  },
  "requested_fields": ["name", "type", "system.quantity"],
  "max_length": 5000
}
```

**Common filter fields:**
- `folder` - Filter by folder ID
- `type` - Filter by document subtype (e.g., "npc", "character" for actors; "weapon", "armor" for items)
- `ownership` - Filter by ownership settings
- Any top-level field on the document can be used as a filter key

### Response Size Management

When working with large worlds, use `max_length` and `requested_fields` to limit response sizes:

```json
{
  "max_length": 10000,
  "requested_fields": ["name", "type", "system.attributes.hp"]
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Version detection**: Queries `/api/status` to detect the Foundry generation (v13 vs v14), which determines how the session binds to the socket
2. **Authentication**: Authenticates with FoundryVTT using the same HTTP POST flow as the official client
3. **WebSocket Connection**: Establishes a persistent Socket.IO/Engine.IO connection, binding the session the way that version expects (query parameter on v13, session cookie on v14), then waits for Foundry to confirm the bound session before issuing requests
4. **Message Exchange**: Exchanges JSON messages using Foundry's native protocol, replying to Engine.IO keepalive pings to hold the connection open
5. **Automatic Reconnection**: Handles connection drops and re-authenticates as needed
